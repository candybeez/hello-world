# hello-world
going through the motions to becoming a git ninja kitty

hello! my name is candy. i have no idea why i'm not using correct captialization or sentence structure. lets forget about that for now. i alwaus seem to go off on a different tanget, which is, as it happens, a perfect thing to say in the current situation... i'm learning about branches at the moment. master branch, branches off the master branch, and commits! branches are more or less types of tangents, if i'm not mistaken! hooray for branches! hooray for tangents!
